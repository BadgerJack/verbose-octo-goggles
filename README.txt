Synopsis

Proof of concept of a digital voting system built on blockchain technology

Motivation

Developed for a final year project, for BSc Computer & Information Security at
Plymouth University. The inspiration for the project included the current political
climate, with a need for secure voting systems being apparent. Blockchain technology
is a modern approach which shows real promise in the world of security.

Installation

Project runtime requires Python3, and includes bottle as standard.

Dependent on paste for network support, although this is configurable.
  pip3 --install paste

If installing through setup.py, requires nose
  pip3 --install nose

API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the
 reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects
  it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs
  live.
