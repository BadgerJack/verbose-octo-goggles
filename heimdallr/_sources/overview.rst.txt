Overview
========
Setting up the application requires a listening device at each location. Set each deviceâ€™s listener to connect to the devices on either side, in effect creating a chain. On those devices being used as a voting device, set up the site file to target the next device in the chain.

To access the application, visit https://localhost:8081/ [default] in a browser. The server is hosted using paste, and can be edited using the paste config file to place it online, or centrally.

A user will log in from the main page [/login] using a voter ID and email address. As authentication is not currently implemented, this is automatically generated. Click confirm. The user is then taken to the election pages. In future iterations, there are plans to edit and add to this with the maintenance page, but for the meantime there is a single election to take part in. Select a party, and confirm. From here the user will be taken to the confirmation page, thanking them for their vote.

There is currently no feature preventing a user from voting twice, as this is tied to authentication. The final page gives some additional instructions for debugging purposes, presenting the reader (reader.py) for viewing the files.

Given an incorrect input, the device will automatically update the files from the host. This should mean that new devices can be added to the chain by only moving around the listeners, as incomplete or unstarted chains will be autogenerated.
