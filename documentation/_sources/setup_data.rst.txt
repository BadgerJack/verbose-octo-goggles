Requirements
============
All modules of Project Heimdallr are written in and require Python3, available at: https://www.python.org/

Installation using the command line requires nose to be installed

pip3 install nose

In order to host the application, a paste server is required. It is recommended that additional configuration is done for the server.

pip3 install paste

Other features such as bottle and pickle are included within the application files and do not need installing.

Whilst Heimdallr is designed as a network application, it has only been tested across LAN and on ports [8000-9999].

Installation
============
Project Heimdallr is available on github at: https://github.com/BadgerJack/verbose-octo-goggles

Installation is as simple as downloading the package and ensuring the requirements are correct.

All files necessary for running the application are contained within [/heimdallr] in the project route, and saved files will appear in [/resources].
