Introduction
============
Welcome to the documentation pages for Project Heimdallr

In these pages we will include guidance for installation and setup of Heimdallr, as well as guidance of the basic functionality and use cases of the project.

Heimdallr is a digital voting application, utilising a blockchain service backend database structure. This is a proof of concept, bolstering the research done by participants in a key blockchain research conference, as a way to improve the security and integrity of voting processes within the UK.

Heimdallr was made as part of a 2017 final year project for BSc Computer & Information Security, at Plymouth University.
